## Understanding Whisk

### What is Google Whisk?
Google Whisk is an experimental AI image generation tool released in December 2024 that revolutionizes creative workflows by using **images as prompts** instead of traditional text descriptions. It combines Google's most advanced AI models to create unique visual content.

### Core Technology Stack
1. **Gemini AI**: Analyzes uploaded images and generates detailed text captions
2. **Imagen 3**: Uses captions to create high-quality, photorealistic images
3. **Veo 2**: Powers the animation feature for image-to-video conversion

### The Whisk Process
```
Your Images → Gemini Analysis → Text Captions → Imagen 3 → Final Image
```

### Key Philosophy
- **Essence over Exactness**: Captures the "essence" of reference images, not exact replicas
- **Rapid Ideation**: Designed for fast visual exploration and experimentation
- **Creative Remixing**: Blends elements from different sources for unique results

---

## Basic Usage

### Interface Overview
The Whisk interface consists of:
- **Left Column**: Three upload areas (Subject, Scene, Style)
- **Bottom Section**: Text prompt box with aspect ratio controls
- **Main Area**: Generated image display and controls

### The Three Pillars of Whisk

#### 1. Subject
- **Purpose**: The main focus of your image
- **Examples**: Characters, objects, animals, people
- **Tips**: Choose clear, well-defined subjects for best results

#### 2. Scene
- **Purpose**: The environment or context
- **Examples**: Backgrounds, locations, settings
- **Tips**: Consider lighting and atmosphere in your scene choice

#### 3. Style
- **Purpose**: The aesthetic direction and visual treatment
- **Examples**: Art styles, materials, techniques, color palettes
- **Tips**: Style references strongly influence the final look

### Basic Workflow
1. **Upload References**: Drag and drop images into Subject, Scene, and/or Style boxes
2. **Add Text Guidance** (Optional): Use the prompt box for additional instructions
3. **Set Aspect Ratio**: Choose from available ratios for your intended use
4. **Generate**: Click generate and wait for results
5. **Refine**: Use the refine button for adjustments if needed
